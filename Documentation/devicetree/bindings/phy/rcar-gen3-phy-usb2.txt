* Renesas R-Car generation 3 USB 2.0 PHY

This file provides information on what the device node for the R-Car generation
3 USB 2.0 PHY contains.

Required properties:
- compatible: "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a7795" if the device is a part of R8A7795 SoC.
- reg: offset and length of the USB2.0 host register block.
- reg-names: must be "usb2".
- clocks: clock phandle and specifier pair.
- clock-names: string, clock input name, must be "usb2", and optional "hsusb".
- #phy-cells: see phy-bindings.txt in the same directory, must be <0>.

Optional proparies:
To use a USB channel which EHCI/OHCI and HSUSB are combined, the device tree
node should set HSUSB proparies to reg and reg-names proparies:
- reg: offset and length of the HSUSB register block.
- reg-names: must be "hsusb".

Example (R-Car H3):

	usb-phy@ee080200 {
		compatible = "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a7795";
		reg = <0 0xee080200 0 0x6ff>, <0 0xe6590100 0 0x100>;
		reg-names = "usb2", "hsusb";
		clocks = <&mstp7_clks R8A7795_CLK_EHCI0>,
			 <&mstp7_clks R8A7795_CLK_HSUSB>;
		clock-names = "usb2", "hsusb";
	};

	usb-phy@ee0a0200 {
		compatible = "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a7795";
		reg = <0 0xee0a0200 0 0x6ff>;
		reg-names = "usb2";
		clocks = <&mstp7_clks R8A7795_CLK_EHCI0>;
		clock-names = "usb2";
	};
