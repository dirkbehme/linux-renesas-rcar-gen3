* Renesas R-Car Gen3 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

The CPG generates core clocks for the R-Car Gen3 SoCs. It includes three PLLs
and several fixed ratio dividers.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must be one of
    - "renesas,r8a7795-cpg-clocks" for the r8a7795 CPG
    - "renesas,rcar-gen3-cpg-clocks" for the generic R-Car Gen3 CPG

  - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG

  - clocks: References to the parent clocks: first to the EXTAL clock
  - #clock-cells: Must be 1
  - clock-output-names: The names of the clocks. Supported clocks are
    "main", "pll0", "pll1", "pll2", "pll3", "pll4"


Example
-------

	cpg_clocks: cpg_clocks@e6150000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a7795-cpg-clocks",
			     "renesas,rcar-gen3-cpg-clocks";
		reg = <0 0xe6150000 0 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&extal_clk>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clock-output-names = "main", "pll0", "pll1","pll2",
				     "pll3", "pll4";
	};
